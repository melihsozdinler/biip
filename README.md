# BIIP
Finding Maximum Edge Biclique in Bipartite Networks by Integer Programming

The paper is under submission to 2018 conferance. In order to use this code make sure you cite it properly. You will find the proper citation after September if paper has the acceptance.

We also include MICA and BIMAX algorithm source codes under the project. We modifed the source code in order to align with time calculations so you can simply compile them using g++.

For BIIP, you can use makefile to compile and for execution you will need Gurobi 6.5 license and installed software in running on Linux machine. For other details and source data you can contact with us using Github email.
